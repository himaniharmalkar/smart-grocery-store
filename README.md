Smart Grocery Store: Market Basket Analysis Using Apriori Algorithm

Project Overview
The Smart Grocery Store project utilizes Market Basket Analysis with the Apriori Algorithm to enhance the shopping experience on an online grocery store platform. By analyzing transactional data, the system provides personalized product recommendations based on frequent itemsets and association rules. This project aims to improve user experience, increase sales, and boost customer satisfaction.

Project Description
This project applies Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori Algorithm to uncover hidden patterns in customer purchasing behavior. By identifying frequently bought products together, the system recommends complementary products to enhance the shopping experience.

Key Features:
1. Frequently Bought Together: Suggests products that are often purchased together with the current items in the cart.
2. Customers Also Bought: Recommends items based on association rules, derived from the Apriori Algorithm.
3. Personalized Recommendations: Enhances user experience by delivering personalized product suggestions.

Algorithms Used: Apriori Algorithm
The main algorithm used for this project is the Apriori Algorithm. It is employed to discover frequent itemsets in transaction data and generate association rules that form the basis of product recommendations.

Working:
Frequent Itemset Mining: Identifies frequent itemsets by calculating support.
Association Rule Generation: Generates association rules using confidence and lift metrics.

Key Metrics
Support: The frequency with which an itemset appears in the dataset. It identifies popular product combinations.
Confidence: Measures the likelihood of the consequent item(s) being purchased when the antecedent item(s) are in the cart.
Lift: Assesses how much more likely the consequent is to be purchased when the antecedent is purchased compared to its standalone likelihood.
